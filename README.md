# hello-world

Hi everyone!

I am Anik. I am interested in FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT. I have worked in projects of Java and Front-End Web Development during my college semesters. During these projects, I've worked in groups with students from all over the country, which made me good at interacting and helping in building team synergy.
